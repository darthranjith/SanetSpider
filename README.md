# SanetSpider

This is a pet project to make my life super easy.
This script will crawl over one of my favorite site https://sanet.st/full and get the latest updates as a csv/xml/xls file

This script is based on Scrapy, so to run this, you need python and scrapy installed

To run this script,

scrappy crawl all -o filename.csv
